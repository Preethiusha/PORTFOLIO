	<h1 class="HEAD">OBSTACLE AVOIDING ROBOT</h1>

	<P><h3>ABSTRACT :</h3>
Autonomous robot is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. If robot finds any obstacle it changes the direction and continue moving.This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot.The application of the this robot is not limited and it is used in most of the military organizations now which helps carry out many risky jobs that cannot be done by any soldiers. This Autonomous vehicle robot is built using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. Here an Ultrasonic sensor is use to sense the obstacles in the path by calculating the distance between the robot and obstacle. Testing and evaluation of the project involves measuring the accuracy of the robot's obstacle detection and avoidance capabilities, including its speed, range, turning radius, and stability. The obstacle avoidance project can be used in various fields such as home automation, surveillance systems, and manufacturing industries, where autonomous robots can prevent accidents and improve efficiency.The project is design to build an obstacle avoidance robotic vehicle using ultrasonic sensors for its movement. A microcontroller (ATmega328) is used to achieve the desired operation. A robot is a machine that can perform task automatically or with guidance. It can be programmed to control the way buttons, motors, switches, lights, and other electronic parts work together.The creation of an obstacle avoiding project is an excellent way to showcase the potential of autonomous robotics and their many practical applications. The capacity of these systems to identify and navigate obstacles autonomously can save lives and reduce human error in critical applications</P>

<h4>ARDUINO UNO:</h4>
<p>Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P
microcontroller. It is widely used for prototyping and developing embedded
systems due to its simplicity and ease of use. The board has 14 digital input/output
pins, 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, an ICSP header, and a reset button.</p>
<h4>L298N DRIVER MODULE:</h4>
<p>The L298N motor driver module is a popular motor driver chip that can be used to
control DC motors, stepper motors, and even servo motors. This module provides
the necessary hardware to control the speed and direction of the motor, making it a
useful component in a wide range of robotics and automation projects.</p>
<h4>ULTRASONIC SENSOR:</h4>
<p>An ultrasonic sensor is a device that uses sound waves of high frequency to
measure the distance to an object.</p>
<h4>SERVO MOTOR:</h4>
<p>A servo motor is a type of motor that is commonly used in robotics and automation
applications. It is a high-precision motor that can rotate to specific angles, making
it ideal for control applications that require precise movement. A servo motor
consists of a DC motor, gearbox, and control circuitry.</p>

<h3>WORKING PRINCIPLE :</h3>
<p>Before going to working of the project, it is important to understand how the
ultrasonic sensor works. The basic principle behind the working of ultrasonic
sensor is as follows:
Using an external trigger signal, the Trig pin on ultrasonic sensor is made logic
high for at least 10Âµs. A sonic burst from the transmitter module is sent. This
consists of 8 pulses of 40kHz.
The signals return back after hitting a surface and the receiver detects this signal.
The Echo pin is high from the time of sending the signal and receiving it. This time
can be converted to distance using appropriate calculations.
The aim of this project is to implement an obstacle avoiding robot using ultrasonic
sensor and Arduino. All the connections are made as per the circuit diagram. The
working of the project is explained below.
When the robot is powered on, both the motors of the robot will run normally and
the robot moves forward. During this time, the ultrasonic sensor continuously
calculate the distance between the robot and the reflective surface.
This information is processed by the Arduino. If the distance between the robot and
the obstacle is less than 25cm, the Robot stops and scans in left and right directions
for new distance using Servo Motor and Ultrasonic Sensor. If the distance towards
the left side is more than that of the right side, the robot will prepare for a left turn.
But first, it backs up a little bit and then activates the Left Wheel Motor in reversed
in direction.
Similarly, if the right distance is more than that of the left distance, the Robot
prepares right rotation. This process continues forever and the robot keeps on
moving without hitting any obstacle</p>

<H3>APPLICATION :</H3>
Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving or driverless vehicles, are
becoming increasingly popular with the advancement of technology. Arduino is a popular platform for designing and developing autonomous vehicles due to its
cost-effectiveness, ease of use, and versatility. Here are some of the applications of
autonomous vehicles using Arduino:
1. Automated Cars: Arduino can be used in developing automated cars that can
drive without the need for human intervention. Arduino is capable of processing
various inputs from sensors, including input from sensors such as ultrasonic,
infrared, and radar, and creating appropriate outputs to control steering, braking,
and acceleration systems.
2. Agricultural Robots: Autonomous vehicles built with Arduino can be used in
agriculture for planting, pruning, and crop management. They can be equipped
with sensors to detect soil moisture and pH levels to optimize crop yield and
reduce labor costs.
3. Delivery Drones: With the rise of online shopping, delivery drones are becoming
increasingly popular. Arduino-based autonomous vehicles can be used to deliver
packages and provide other logistics services with high precision.
4. Indoor Navigation: Autonomous vehicles built with Arduino can be used for
indoor navigation in warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and smart homes. They
can navigate through complex environments and avoid collisions using sensor data.
5. Security Robots: Autonomous vehicles equipped with Arduino can be used to
detect and respond to security threats. These robots can patrol buildings, detect
intruders, and alert security personnel of potential problems.
Overall, autonomous vehicles built with Arduino offer incredible potential for
creating innovative applications that can revolutionize transportation, logistics, and
security systems.
