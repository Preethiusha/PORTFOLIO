	<h1>SMART VACCUM CLEANER FOR HOSPITALS</h1>
</div>
	<h2>ABSTRACT:</h2>
	<P>The objective of this study is to design and develop a low-cost Arduino autonomous robot cleaner using mapping algorithm to clean floor area of hospitals. The idea is basically to detect any obstacles with the help of sensor and sent its output to microcontroller that will control the autonomous vacuum cleaner movement. A low-cost solution is proposed in this study by using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance and control by Arduino UNO. By using an autonomous vacuum cleaner, user can turn ON the autonomous vacuum robot to clean without any help of a human operator. Additionally, instead of using the traditional button or switch to activate the robot, voice recognition through Google Assistant implemented in this project. Hence, this provides a more user friendly platform not only for normal user but also help visually impaired people to activate the robot.</P>
<H2>PURPOSE:</H2>
<P>The purpose of a Smart Vacuum Cleaner designed for hospitals encompasses several key objectives aimed at improving cleanliness, hygiene, and operational efficiency within healthcare facilities. Here are some primary purposes: Enhanced Infection Control, Optimized Cleaning Efficiency, Operational Monitoring and Management, Cost Savings and Resource Efficiency.</P>
