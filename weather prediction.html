	<h1>WEATHER PREDICTION USING ML</h1>
<H2>ABSTRACT:</H2>
	<P>The development and deployment of a machine learning (ML) model for weather prediction, utilizing a combination of algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. Through rigorous experimentation, the Decision Tree algorithm emerged as the most accurate predictor for weather forecasting. Leveraging the trained dataset, a web application was designed and implemented to disseminate weather information for the upcoming five days. The application harnesses the predictive power of the Decision Tree model to offer users reliable forecasts. This  abstract highlights the significance of employing ML techniques, specifically the Decision Tree algorithm, in real-world applications such as weather prediction, enhancing accessibility and accuracy of weather forecasts through user-friendly interfaces.</P>

<h2>PROPOSED METHOD:</h2>
<p>We've devised a weather prediction system utilizing ML, trained on a dataset to learn the weather prediction process. Employing diverse ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and KNN. we analyzed training data and predicted outcomes for the test set. Visualizing dataset features through bar plots enhanced our data exploration and insights.By Comparing Three algorithm the system will give the more accurate result. We've created a webpage to visualizing the final predicted weather.

<ul><li>Raw Data: This is the unprocessed data you collect, which can be in various formats including text and numerical data. </li>
<li>Text Data: This block refers to the process of separating text data from raw data if applicable. </li>
<li> Train Data: This subset of the data is used to train the machine learning model.</li>
<li>Preprocessing: This stage involves cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for training the model. This can include:</li>
<ol class="c">

<li>	Handling missing values: This can involve removing rows with missing data or replacing them with estimates. The image specifically mentions “elimination” of null values.</li>
<li>
Inconsistent data removal: This refers to removing outliers or errors from the data set. The image specifically mentions “Inconsistent data removal.”</li></ol>
<li>Feature Extraction: This step involves creating new features from the existing data. These features are characteristics that the machine learning model can use to learn from.</li>
<li>Dimensionality Reduction: If you have a high number of features, this step can help reduce them to a more manageable size. This can improve the efficiency of the model. </li>
<li>Sampling: This involves selecting a representative subset of the data to train the model on. This can be useful if the dataset is too large to process all at once. </li>
<li>Train-Test Split: This involves dividing the data into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. </li>
<li>Learning Algorithm: This is the algorithm that the model uses to learn from the data. The image shows three common learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN. </li>
<li>Label: This refers to the target variable that the model is trying to predict. </li>
<li> Prediction: This is the output of the machine learning model. </li>
<li> Visualization: This step involves creating visualizations of the data to help understand the model’s performance. The image specifically mentions “Bar plots” for visualization.
